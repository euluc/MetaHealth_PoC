# Proof of Concept: OneTouch's MetaHealth

This is a proof of concept made for the OneTouch's Metahealth project! It consists in a AR experience for the Microsoft's
HoloLens2 based on a medical surgery for babies who were born with macrocephaly. The POC was made with Unity. <br>

<h1> Goals </h1>
<p>
	This POC had two main goals: <br>
	<b> 1: To have a multiplayer lobby where multiple HoloLens are able to connect and see objects asynchronously. </b> <br>
	<b> 2: To holoportate real-life objects with a Microsoft Azure Kinect DK. </b> <br>
</p>

<h1> Problems </h1>
<h3> <p> Problem 1: Multiplayer asynchronously lobby </p> </h3>
<p>
	The idea here was to create a multiplayer lobby where multiple HoloLenses could connect and see the same
	asynchronously objects. The objects on the scene would be an animated doctor performing a surgery and a
	menu to play, pause and stop the animation. The idea was that people with HoloLens would simply open the
	same build and would connect automatically to the lobby, and all HoloLens connected to the lobby would be
	able to start, play, pause or stop the animation, besides seeing it and hearing it sound.
</p>
<h3> <p> Problem 2: Holoportation </p> </h3>
<p>
	For this, we wanted to be able to holoportate objects within a squared space defined by 4 Microsoft Azure
	Kinect DK's cameras. All objects within the square should be able to be seen by someone with a HoloLens that
	was in a different network. We wanted that a doctor in A with a HoloLens, that was contained in the squared
	space mentioned before, should be able a doctor in B with the same conditions, and vice-versa. With that, they
	would be able to help each other easily.
</p>

<h1> Achieved </h1>
<p>
	We were able to achieve the creation of the asynchronously lobby, but we were not able to achieve sharing data
	between clients, even if the clients were in the same network. Also, we were not able to share the holoported data
	across the network, so clients in different networks were not able to see each other's data.
</p>

<h1> Results: Sufficient </h1>
<p>
	We did not achieve what was expected with this first version. However, setting up this POC in the time that we had (only 8
	days to do everything from scratch!) and making it work on a local machine only (with the asynchronous data) was enough
	based on what's was asked.
